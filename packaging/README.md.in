# EAR Production Suite (v1.2.1 release)

The latest builds of the EAR Production Suite are available under [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ebu/ear-production-suite/releases) or from the [EAR Production Suite website.](https://ear-production-suite.ebu.io/)
Please download the files from there. The EAR Production Suite (EPS) download package comprises of multiple components:

- EPS VST® Plug-ins
- EPS REAPER Extension
- ADM Export Source VST® Plug-in
- REAPER project templates
- Project Upgrade Utility (for REAPER projects created with EPS v0.6.0 beta)
- Setup application

## Release notes

v1.2.1 is a general bug fix release and includes minor changes to support newer versions of REAPER.

Note that some fixes in this release have required bumping the minimum required REAPER version from v6.11 to v6.37. This release also removes support for 3rd-party plugin suites (FB360/VISR) since this feature is rarely used and maintaining the code to support them adds significant development overhead.

### Known issues
The EPS exports ADM using egocentric, polar coordinates and conforming to the [EBU Broadcast Production Profile](https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/tech3392).
It is very tolerant in the ADM it will import meaning it can import files that conform to other profiles.
ADM authored using the [Dolby Atmos ADM](https://professionalsupport.dolby.com/s/article/Dolby-Atmos-ADM-Profile-specification?language=en_US) profile can be imported, but coordinates and directspeakers pack formats are converted on import and exported files will instead conform to the Production Profile.
To import Production Profile ADM in to third-party tools which do not support this profile, the ADM must be converted. BBC R&D along with the EBU have developed the [EBU ADM Toolkit](https://github.com/ebu/ebu-adm-toolbox) to assist with this task.

### Changes

@CHANGELOG@

### 0.6.0
* Initial beta release

## Installation

The EPS is designed for REAPER 64-bit, on a 64-bit OS (MacOS, Windows or Linux (experimental))

### Automatic Installation

For MacOS or Windows, the easiest way to install the software is to use the included Setup application.

1. Install [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/download.php) if you don't already have it.
2. Extract the release package (Windows only - Mac will install directly from the DMG).
3. Ensure REAPER is not running.
4. Run the `Setup EAR Production Suite` application in the package and follow on-screen instructions.

### Manual Installation

You may install the EPS manually if you prefer (note that this is the only option for Linux currently).

1. Install [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/download.php) if you don't already have it.
2. Ensure REAPER is not running.
3. From the release package, copy the **VST plug-ins** from the `VST3` directory of the package (or within `Setup EAR Production Suite.app/Contents/Resources` on MacOS) into your common VST folder. 
    - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`
    - MacOS: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`
    - Linux: `~/.vst3/`
4. From the release package, copy the REAPER ADM **Extension** from the `UserPlugins` directory of the package (or within `Setup EAR Production Suite.app/Contents/Resources` on MacOS) into the REAPER UserPlugins folder.
    - Windows: `C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\REAPER\UserPlugins\`
          Note: If you have a previous version of the REAPER Extension installed to `C:\Program Files\REAPER (x64)\Plugins\reaper_adm.dll`, then this should be deleted on installation of the latest version.
    - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/UserPlugins/`
    - Linux: `~/.config/REAPER/UserPlugins/`
5. (Optional) From the release package, copy the `Tools` and `Templates` directories of the package (or from within `Setup EAR Production Suite.app/Contents/Resources` on MacOS) into an `EAR Production Suite` directory in the relevant location listed below. This is the folder used by the "Browse tools and templates..." function of the EPS.
    - Windows: `C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\EAR Production Suite\`
    - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/EAR Production Suite/`
    - Linux: `~/.config/EAR Production Suite/`

## Confirming Installation and Troubleshooting

### REAPER Extension

Open REAPER and select `Extensions` from the menu bar. Under this menu should be a new option labelled `EAR Production Suite`. This confirms that the extension was installed and loaded successfully. 
Check the version number of the extension by going to `Extensions > EAR Production Suite > About EAR Production Suite`.

If the extension is not present and you are using Windows, it might be necessary to download and install the [Visual C++ redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) ("vc_redist.x64.exe") from Microsoft.

### VST Plug-ins

Open REAPER and select a blank FX slot on a track to open the plug-in selection dialog. The EAR Production Suite plug-ins should now be listed in the dialog. 
For all plug-ins, the version number is stated in the bottom right-hand corner of the GUIs.

If any plug-ins are missing, you can force REAPER to update its plug-in lists by going to `Options > Preferences > Plug-Ins > VST` and clicking `Rescan`.

## How to use (short version)
### Import ADM Files
1. From the REAPER menu bar, select `File > Create Project from ADM file > Create from ADM using EAR` and choose the file to import.
2. Wait while all ADM elements are being created as tracks and automation curves along with metadata input plug-ins for each object or channel bed. There will be also tracks created with the "EAR Scene" plug-in and with a monitoring plug-in.
3. Enjoy :)

### Create from scratch
1. Add an "EAR Object" Plug-in for each audio object track or an "EAR DirectSpeakers" Plug-in for a channel bed. Disable Master Send on the track. Make sure to increase the track mapping parameter value +1 for each new audio object input plug-in (or + the number of your channel bed). So the first audio object track in the REAPER project should be one, the next two, ...
2. Create a new track for the "EAR Scene" plug-in and add it there. Change the bus size to 64 and disable Master Send on the track.
3. Connect all audio objects tracks to the "EAR Scene" track as "Receives" in the I/O option. Make sure to choose the correct bus size (i.e. Mono).
4. Create a new track for the EAR Monitoring Plug-in and add it there. Change the bus size to 64.
5. Connect the Scene track to the Monitoring track as "Receives" in the I/O options.
6. Add the hardware output for the Monitoring track in the I/O options or allow it to send via Master.
7. Enter and author your ADM parameters in Object, DirectSpeakers and Scene Plug-ins. **Please note that the Scene Plug-in is steering what you hear. So any items which are not added to a programme there, will not be rendered!**
8. Enjoy :)

### Start with project template
We have provided a project template and several example projects in the download package. To begin with the simple template;

1. Open the templates in REAPER
2. You will find a number of tracks with plug-ins for further usage
    - Two object tracks
    - One channel-based track
    - One EAR Scene bus
    - Two EAR Monitoring buses, one for Stereo monitoring and one for 5.1
3. The Scene Plug-in has already two audio programmes, one called "English" and one "German"
4. All metadata connections between the plug-ins and I/O routings are set. You can start by importing your audio files into the tracks.
5. Switch between the different renderings by exclusive-soloing (CMD+Alt+Click (MacOS) / Ctrl+Alt+Click (Win)) the monitoring tracks.

The other projects provide examples of a broader range of use cases and some test audio so you can try the example projects straight away.

Please note: The tutorial video covers manual installation of the EPS. With v1.0.0+, it is must easier to use the included Setup application. Additionally, the video advises to install the REAPER extension to the REAPER directory of `Program Files` on Windows. Although this will be functional, it is now advised to install to your user directory instead. Please see the [installation](#installation) instructions in this file.

## Use of Binaural Monitoring plug-in

The Binaural Monitoring plug-in can be used in exactly the same way as the existing Monitoring plug-ins for loudspeakers; simply place the Binaural Monitoring plug-in on a new 64-channel track and route all 64 channels of the Scene plug-in track to it.

The Binaural Monitoring plug-in supports 3DoF (three degrees-of-freedom). That is, the plug-in will respond to listener orientation changes. The plug-in provides Yaw, Pitch and Roll controls to define head orientation. These can be driven automatically using head-trackers which generate OSC. It is compatible with OSC message formats used by other third-party spatial audio plug-ins, including SPARTA/COMPASS, IEM, 3D Tune-In Toolkit, Ambix plug-ins, AudioLab SALTE, and Mach1 Monitor. Therefore, any head-tracker which is compatible with any of those plug-ins should also be compatible with the EAR Production Suite Binaural Monitoring plug-in. Below is a complete list of OSC paths observed. Note that you will need to ensure the Binaural Monitoring plug-in is listening for messages on the correct port using the control within the user interface, and enabled using the switch control.

- **/yaw *y*, /pitch *p*, /roll *r*** - Euler in Degrees, as used by SPARTA/COMPASS 
- **/ypr *y p r*** - Euler in Degrees, as used by SPARTA/COMPASS 
- **/hedrot/yaw *y*, /hedrot/pitch *p*, /hedrot/roll *r*** - Euler in Degrees, as used by HedRot
- **/rotation *p y r*** - Euler in Degrees, as used by Matthias Kronlachner's Ambix plug-ins
- **/rendering/htrpy *r p y*** - Euler in Degrees, as used by AudioLab SALTE
- **/orientation *y p r*** - Euler in Degrees, as used by Mach1 Monitor
- **/3DTI-OSC/receiver/pry *p r y*** - Euler in Radians, as used by 3D Tune-In Toolkit
- **/quaternion *w y z x*** - Quaternions, as used by SPARTA/COMPASS
- **/SceneRotator/quaternions *w x y z*** - Quaternions, as used by IEM
- **/quaternions *w y z x*** - Quaternions, as used by Unity
- **/head_pose** *a b c d* ***p y r*** - Euler in Degrees, as used by Matthias Kronlachner's Ambix plug-ins (note that the first 4 parameters are ignored in this case.)

The [nvsonic Head Tracker](https://github.com/trsonic/nvsonic-head-tracker) provides a cheap, compatible and tested head-tracker which can output all of the above formats, and can therefore drive the Binaural Monitoring plug-in. 

## What's still missing
- No support for Binaural and Matrix typeDefinition.
- No support for "nested" Objects - on import, ADM Programmes are currently flattened to a single tier of Objects.
- Only one instance of EAR Scene should run on a machine at any time. 
- ...
