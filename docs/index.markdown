title: EAR Production Suite
subtitle: A collection of production tools for Audio Definition Model (ADM) compliant production, brought to you by EBU, BBC R&D and IRT.
---

<div markdown="1" class="text_section">
The EAR Production Suite (EPS) is a set of VSTÂ® plugins for digital audio workstations (DAWs) that enable sound engineers to produce immersive and personalizable content using the [Audio Definition Model](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2076) (ADM) format and to monitor it for any [ITU-R BS.2051](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2051/en) loudspeaker configuration using the [ITU ADM Renderer](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2127/en). ADM is the only format available for codec-agnostic [Next Generation Audio](https://tech.ebu.ch/nga) (NGA) productions. Moreover, the EAR Production Suite enables professionals to import and export ADM files, compliant to the [EBU ADM Production profile](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3392.pdf). The VSTÂ® plugins are currently optimized for the Reaper DAW, which features an extension interface that is used to import and export ADM files within a BW64 container. The EAR Production Suite was designed to demonstrate the intended use of the ADM in audio production workflows, so that the standards can be adopted in other professional tools in a consistent manner.

The EAR Production Suite is a joint [open-source development](https://github.com/ebu/ear-production-suite) of [BBC R&D](https://bbc.co.uk/rd) and [IRT](https://www.irt.de/en/home).

## Quickstart

<details>
  <summary>Import ADM Files</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Select in the menu <b>File -> Create Project from ADM file -> Create from ADM using EAR</b></li>
    <li>Wait while all ADM elements are being created as tracks and automation curves along with metadata input plugins for each object or channel bed. There will be also tracks and plugins created for the Scene and the Monitoring.</li>
    <li>Disable "Master send" for the <b>Monitoring</b> track routing and add your hardware output there</li>
    <li>Enjoy :)</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Start with session template</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Open template in REAPER</li>
    <li>You will find a number of tracks with plugins for further usage
      <br>- Two object tracks
      <br>- One channel-based track
      <br>- One EAR Scene bus
      <br>- Two EAR Monitoring buses, one for Stereo monitoring and one for 5.1
    </li>
    <li>The Scene Plugin has already two audio programmes, one called "English" and one "German"</li>
    <li>All metadata connections between the plugins and I/O routings are set. You can start by importing your audio files into the tracks.</li>
    <li>Switch between the different renderings by exclusive-soloing (CMD+Alt+Click (macOS) / Ctrl+Alt+Click (Win)) the monitoring tracks.</li>
  </ol>

## Installation
The EPS is designed for REAPER 64-bit, on a 64-bit OS (macOS or Windows)
  <details>
    <summary>Show installation instructions</summary>
      <div class="text_section">
        <i><b>Please Note:</b><br /> The EPS is currently incompatible with Language Packs. REAPER may fail to load when using the EPS with a language pack installed. Support will be provided in a future release.</i>
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>Install <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/download.php">REAPER</a></li>
        <li>Copy / install the <b>VST plugins</b> into your common VST folder.
          <br>- Windows: C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3
          <br>- macOS: ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3
        </li>
        <li>Open REAPER and go to Options -> Preferences -> Plug-Ins -> VST and click Rescan</li>
        <li>Copy / install REAPER ADM <b>Extension</b> into the REAPER plugins folder. Ensure you include the ADMPresets subdirectory.
          <br>- Windows: C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\REAPER\UserPlugins
          <br>- macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/UserPlugins
        </li>
        <li>Restart REAPER</li>
        <li>You should see a new menu option <b>File -> Create Project from ADM file</b> now. If you don't see this option and you are using Windows, it might be neccesary to download and install the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads">Visual C++ 2015 redistributable</a> ("vc_redist.x64.exe") from Microsoft.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
  <details>
    <summary>Will my exported ADM BW64 files work with other tools, such as the Dolby Atmos Production Suite?</summary>
      <div class="text_section">
        <p>Currently the files are not compatible with the Dolby Atmos Production Suite.</p>
        <p>The cause of this problem is that each set of tools currently uses a different ADM profile. The EAR Production Suite uses the <a href="https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3392.pdf">EBU ADM Production profile</a>, whereas the Dolby Atmos tools use <a href="https://developer.dolby.com/technology/dolby-atmos/adm-atmos-profile/">Dolbyâ€™s ADM profile specification</a>. The EAR Production Suite provides a conversion from the Dolby profile on import, however it only exports to the EBU Production profile and the Dolby tools do not accept this as input. We hope to provide support for ADM profile conversion in future.</p>
        <p>More generally, ADM support has been implemented by different manufacturers and there are currently some interoperability issues. The EBU ADM Production profile is not yet widely supported, but we are working with the industry to ensure proper interoperability, using common profiles at the various stages from production through to emission.</p>

    <summary>Which head-trackers are compatible with the Binaural Monitoring plug-in?</summary>
      <div class="text_section">
        <p>The Binaural Monitoring plug-in accepts listener orientation data over OSC and responds to messages used by several other popular spatial audio plug-in suites. 
		Therefore, if you have a head-tracker which functions with SPARTA/COMPASS, IEM, ambiX, HedRot, AudioLab SALTE, Mach1, or the 3D Tune-In Toolkit, then it should also function with the EPS Binaural Monitoring plug-in.
		Simply ensure that the "Enable OSC" toggle is on, and that the port number is configured to match that of your head-tracker.
		Note that the plug-in can not use the port if another plug-in is already using it, so please ensure no other plug-ins are present which use the same port.
		</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px">If you would like to construct your own low-cost head-tracker for use with the Binaural Monitoring plug-in, consider the <a href="https://github.com/trsonic/nvsonic-head-tracker">nvsonic Head-Tracker</a> for a compatible solution. It should operate with the Binaural Monitoring plug-in using any of the presets for the third-party spatial audio plug-ins listed above.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-top: 20px">We are keen to gather feedback on head-tracker compatibility, whether good or bad. Head over to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/makerbox/tools/ear-production-suite">discussion community on BBC MakerBox</a> and let us know of your experience.
